# Contributing to React Zero-UI

**Thanks for stopping by.** This project exists because builders like you push boundaries. If you're here to experiment, break things, or ship speed - you're in the right place.

---

## ⚡ Core Philosophy

**React Zero-UI** is built on a radical idea:

> UI state should not require re-rendering.  
> CSS and `data-*` attributes can be enough.

It's fast because it **skips the VDOM entirely** - no state triggers, no diffing, no component redraws.

### If you contribute:

Stay **pre-rendered, declarative, and brutally fast.**

## 🧠 Monorepo Structure

```
📁 packages/
├── core            ➡️ @react-zero-ui/core (library logic + postcss)
├── cli             ➡️ create-zero-ui (npx installer)
└── eslint-zero-ui  ➡️ eslint-zero-ui - in development
```

---

## ⚙️ Local Setup

```bash
pnpm bootstrap    # builds + installs local tarball into test fixtures
pnpm test         # runs all tests (unit + E2E)
```

> Node 18+ and PNPM required.  
> Run from repo root.

## ✅ Contribution Flow

### 1. [Start a Discussion](https://github.com/react-zero-ui/core/discussions)

For questions, proposals, or early feedback. Share ideas before building.

### 2. [Open an Issue](https://github.com/react-zero-ui/core/issues)

Use the templates.

- **Bug** ➡️ Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior.
- **Feature** ➡️ Explain the _why_, and sketch a possible approach.

### 3. Pull Requests

- Use semantic commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`
- Add tests if you touch logic, CLI, or rendering behavior.
- Keep PRs focused - one change per pull.
- Fill out the PR template - no empty descriptions.
